## Where we come from

+ introduction to geostatistics
+ mathematics, linear algebra
+ computer science

### Introduction to geostatistics

+ types of variables: Stevens' measurement scales -- nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio
+ ... or: discrete, continuous
+ t-tests, ANOVA
+ regression, multiple regression (but not how we compute it)
+ assumption was: observations are _independent_
+ what does independence mean?

### In this course
+ we will study dependence in observations, in 
    + space
    + time
    + or space-time
+ in space and/or time, Stevens' measurement scales are not enough! Examples:
    + linear time, cyclic time
    + space: functions, fields
+ we will study how we can represent phenomena, by
    + mathematical representations (models)
    + computer representations (models)
+ we will consider how well these models correspond to our observations

## Spatio-temporal phenomena are everywhere
+ if we think about it, there are no data that can be non-spatial or non-temporal.
+ in many cases, the spatial or temporal references are not essential
    + think: brain image of a person: time matters, but mostly referenced with respect to the age of the person, spatial location of the MRI scanner does not
    + but: ID of the patient does!
    + and: time of scan matters too!
+ we will "pigeon-hole" (classify) phenomena into: fields, objects, aggregations

### Fields

+ many processes can be represented by fields, meaning they could be measured everywhere
+ think: temperature in this room
+ typical problems: interpolation, patterns, trends, temporal development, forecasting?

### Objects and events

+ objects can be identified 
+ objects are identified within a frame (or _window_) of observation
+ within this window, between objects, there are no objects (no point of interpolation)
+ objects can be moving (people), or static (buildings)
+ objects or events are sometimes obtained by thresholding fields, think heat wave, earthquake, hurricane, [see e.g.
  @camara2014fields]
+ sometimes this view is rather artificial, think cars, persons, buildings

### Fields - objects/events conversions
+ we can convert a field into an object by thresholding (wind field, storm or hurricane)
+ we can convert objects into a field e.g. by computing the density as a continuous function

### Aggregations
+ we can aggregate fields, or objects, but do this differently:
+ population can be summed, temperature cannot (see [intensive/extensive properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_and_extensive_properties))

## Aims of modelling
... could be

+ curiousity
+ fun: studying models is easier than measuring the world around us

More scientific aims of modelling are 

+ to learn about the world around us
+ to predict the past, current or future, in case where measurement is not feasible.

### What is a model?

+ conceptual models, e.g. the water cycle ([wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Water_cycle.png):) ![the water cycle](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/94/Water_cycle.png)

 ![the water cycle, updated](https://i0.wp.com/eos.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/usgs-water-cycle.png)

+ object models, such as UML ([wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:UML_diagrams_overview.svg):) ![UML](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/UML_diagrams_overview.svg)
+ mathematical models, such as Navier Stokes' equation, ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations):)
![Navier Stokes equation](http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/4/f/e/4fef570fa684173cbc6e70a904dd5e66.png) 

### What is a mathematical model?
A mathematical model is an abstract model that uses mathematical
language to describe the behaviour of a system, quoting [@eykhoff]
a mathematical model is:

> a representation of the essential aspects of an existing system (or
> a system to be constructed) which presents knowledge of that system in
> usable form 

In the natural sciences, a model is always an approximation, a
simplification of reality. If degree of approximation meets the required
accuracy, the model is useful, or valid (of value). A validated model
does not imply that the model is "true"; more than one model can be
valid at the same time.
