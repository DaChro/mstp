<h1>Spatial temporal variation modelled by differential equations</h1>

<h3>Deterministic spatial dynamic models</h3>

<p>Deterministic models are based on the assumption that the processes
governing change are known. Given that knowledge, we need</p>

<ul>
<li>the state of a system (initial conditions), and</li>
<li>the characteristics at boundaries of the system (boundary
conditions): what are the sources and sinks, when does what escape or enter the
modelled area.</li>
</ul>

<p>for a (perfect) prediction of the changes over time, and in space.</p>

<p>Let us look at an example: air quality (fine particles, PM10).</p>

<h3>Model domain</h3>

<p>For a model, we need a <em>model domain</em>, which is the spatial
area and temporal period over which we will define processes and
conditions. This could be e.g. Western Europe, 1980-2010, or NRW,
2000-2005, or the area not further than 100 m away from the crossing
Weseler Strasse-Bonhoeffer Strasse, Jan 8, 2008, 0:00-24:00. It should
be exactly quantifiable/traceable.</p>

<h3>Initial conditions</h3>

<p>The initial conditions usually describe the variable of interest (the
concentration field) at the highest possible level of detail. In our
case this is the PM10 concentration field at the start of the modelling
period.</p>

<p>As this is a continuous field, we need some way to describe this and
usually the spatial domain is discretized into model usually
square, rectuangular or triangular model elements.</p>

<p>This discretization should match the level of detail </p>

<ul>
<li>at which we know initial conditions and </li>
<li>at which we want to model features. </li>
</ul>

<p>As an example: if we want to quantify the effect of individual
car fumes, spatial elements of 10 cm&ndash;1 m may work; if we want to
describe the effect of a complete streets something of 10m&ndash;100m
seems more appropriate. Smaller elements and time steps mean more
memory and CPU time requirements.</p>

<h3>Initial conditions-2</h3>

<p>If we don&#39;t know initial conditions exactly, we may put the starting
point of the modelling domain further back in the past, and hope that
the effect of approximation will damp out as we model. (This assumes
we get the boundary conditions and processes right.)</p>

<h3>Boundary conditions</h3>

<p>PM10 comes and goes. Sources are (i) emissions inside the model domain
(cars, households, industry), and (ii) material that enters the model
domain by movement of air bodies, but emitted elsewhere. We need these
source terms (points, lines or fields) in space, and over time.</p>

<p>Sinks are mostly air that moves out of the model domain, and wash out
(rain), dry deposition (your grandmother&#39;s white sheets turning black),
and &hellip; inhalation. These terms are also needed, quantitatively.</p>

<h3>Processes</h3>

<p>Particles move mostly for two or three reasons: by large-scale movement of
air (wind), by medium/small-scale movement of air (turbulence, dispersion)
and by themselves (diffusion; think Brownian motian of a single particle
in a gas).</p>

<p>As an example, take a look at the LOTOS-EUROS model
(<a href="http://www.lotos-euros.nl/">http://www.lotos-euros.nl/</a>) model documentation.</p>

<p>As you can read in the <em>model formulation and domain</em>, the model
uses external modelling results (interpolation or mechanistic modelling)
to get the atmospheric driving forces (height mixing layer, wind fields),
e.g. from FUB and ECMWF (<a href="http://www.ecmwf.int/">http://www.ecmwf.int/</a>).</p>

<p>Basically, the model <em>code</em> </p>

<ul>
<li>reads a lot of initial and boundary data, </li>
<li>solves the differential equations and </li>
<li>writes out everything that is of interest, such as the space-time concentration fields.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Solving differential equations</h3>

<p>The partial differential equation solved in LOTOS_EUROS is
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_equation">continuity equation</a>
\[
\frac{\delta C}{\delta t} +
U\frac{\delta C}{\delta x} +
V\frac{\delta C}{\delta y} +
W\frac{\delta C}{\delta z} \]
\[
= \frac{\delta}{\delta x}(K_h \frac{\delta C}{\delta x})  +
\frac{\delta}{\delta y}(K_h \frac{\delta C}{\delta y})  +
\frac{\delta}{\delta z}(K_z \frac{\delta C}{\delta z})  +E+R+Q-D-W
\]
with (mostly quoted from the <a href="http://www.lotos-euros.nl/documentation/LOTOS-EUROS_v2.0_Reference-Guide_R10898.pdf">reference guide</a>, page 6/7:</p>

<ul>
<li>\(t,x,y,z\) time and the three space dimensions</li>
<li>\(C\) concentration of the pollutant (dynamic field)</li>
<li>\(U,V,W\) the large scale wind components in respectively west-east
direction, in south-north direction and in vertical direction</li>
<li>\(K_h,K_z\) the horizontal and vertical turbulent diffusion coefficients</li>
<li>\(E\) the entrainment or detrainment due to variations in layer 
height. </li>
<li>\(R\) the amount of material produced or destroyed as a result of 
chemistry. </li>
<li>\(Q\) is the contribution by emissions, </li>
<li>\(D\) and \(W\) loss terms due to processes of dry and wet deposition respectively</li>
</ul>

<p>To solve this equation, it needs to be discretized in space and
time. For this particular model, the spatial grid size is 0.5 degree
longitude \(\times\) 0.25 degree latitude (meaning that grid cells
do not have constant area), and time step is 1h.</p>

<h3>Solving PDE&#39;s</h3>

<p>The simples method to solve PDE&#39;s by discretization is, <em>finite difference</em>, uses a regular mesh size, \(\Delta x\). The solution is computed at
location \(j \Delta x\), with \(j=1,&hellip;,N\).</p>

<p>In one dimension the first derivative uses one of the three approximations:</p>

<ul>
<li>backward: 
\[\frac{\delta u}{\delta x}(j \Delta x) \approx \frac{u_j-u_{j-1}}{\Delta x} \]</li>
<li>forward:
\[\frac{\delta u}{\delta x}(j \Delta x) \approx \frac{u_{j+1}-u_{j}}{\Delta x} \]</li>
<li>centered:
\[\frac{\delta u}{\delta x}(j \Delta x) \approx \frac{u_{j+1}-u_{j-1}}{2\Delta x} \]
and for the second order derivative (centered):
\[\frac{\delta^2 u}{\delta x^2}(j \Delta x) \approx \frac{u_{j+1}-2u_j+u_{j-1}}{(\Delta x)^2} \]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Diffusion equations, 1-D</h3>

<p>Diffusion happens in space-time. Using a mesh in space-time, we can write
\(u(j \Delta x, n \Delta t) \approx u^n_j\) with \(n\) a superscript, not power.</p>

<p>We can approximate the PDE
\[\frac{\delta u}{\delta t} = \frac{\delta^2 u}{\delta x^2}, \ \mbox{with} \ u(x,0)=\phi(x) \]</p>

<p>by finite difference, in time:
\[\frac{\delta u}{\delta t}(j \Delta x, n \Delta t) \approx \frac{u_{j}^{n+1}-u_{j}^n}{\Delta t}\]
and space:
\[\frac{\delta u}{\delta x}(j \Delta x, n \Delta t) \approx \frac{u_{j+1}^{n}-u_j^n}{\Delta x}\]</p>

<p>Using forward difference for \(t\) and centered for \(x\), combining both, the
corresponding finite difference equation that approximates the PDE it is:
\[\frac{u_j^{n+1}-u_j^n}{\Delta t} = \frac{u^n_{j+1}-2u_j^n+u_{j-1}^n}{(\Delta x)^2}.\]</p>

<h3>Forward/backward, explicit/implicit</h3>

<p>Solving
\[\frac{u_j^{n+1}-u_j^n}{\Delta t} = \frac{u^n_{j+1}-2u_j^n+u_{j-1}^n}{(\Delta x)^2}.\]
is trivial, as \(n+1\) is only in the LHS. This means that for each \(x\) we can solve
the equation explicitly, where we start is not important. They require, for stable solutions,
that \(\frac{\Delta t}{(\Delta x)^2} \le \frac{1}{2}\).  See examples.</p>

<p>If the equation were instead
\[\frac{u_j^{n+1}-u_j^n}{\Delta t} = \frac{u^{n+1}_{j+1}-2u_j^{n+1}+u_{j-1}^{n+1}}{(\Delta x)^2}.\]
then we have the unknown \(u^{n+1}\) both left and right of the equal sign. This requires the solution
of a (sparse) set of coupled linear equations, and this solution is called <em>implicit</em>. It pays off: the
solutions are stable, and larger time steps can be chosen (provided of course, that change is close
to linear over the time step).</p>

<h3>Calibrating deterministic models</h3>

<p>Models based on partial differential equations have parameters; think
of diffusion parameters, source and sink terms (boundary conditions),
and initial conditions. These need to be filled in, somehow.</p>

<p>Given that observation data on the model outcome are available, one way
to fill these in is to search for values such that the model predictions
best fit the data. We have seen methods for this; there is a long list
of further, possibly more advanced or efficient methods for finding
optimal parameter values, both in a deterministic (<em>optimum</em>) sense,
and in a stochastic (<em>distribution</em>) sense.</p>

<p>Also, choosing optimality criterium (least squares? least absolute
differences? combined criteria over multiple variables?)</p>

<h3>Difficulties in calibration</h3>

<p>Problems that may occur with calibrating models are numerous. </p>

<p>One problem may be that the parameter we tune (optimize) is not constant
over space or time, but varies. This means that there instead of one
single value, there may be numerous. Their number may outnumber the
observations, and in that case there is little hope in finding realistic
values.</p>

<p>Another problem is that we may tune a parameter and get a better fit, but
that in reality we turned the wrong button, meaning we get a better
fit <em>for the wrong reason</em>. This may have disasterous effects when
using this <em>optimized</em> model in a prediction setting (such as future
forecasting, or scenario evaluation).</p>

<p>Automatic codes exist (e.g. PEST, or &#39;&#39;optim&#39;&#39; in R) that optimize
models, irrespective what the model is or does.</p>

<h3>More difficulties</h3>

<p>Deterministic models use a temporal and spatial discretization. This
is a balance between CPU and memory costs, and the ability to fill the
discrete elements sensibly. Processes need to be <em>lumped</em>, meaning
that they cannot be taken into account because of the grid cell size
(think of convection above a forest, or a thunder storm, when grid cell
size is 50 km, and/or time step a day). Choosing a finer resolution,
the parameters, processes, boundary and initial values need to be filled
in with much more resolution (precision), and need disaggregation &ndash;
e.g. a country total emission may need to be assigned to 1 km \(\times\)
1 km grid cells.</p>

<h3>Dynamic parameter updating schemes</h3>

<p>A probabilistic setting of a deterministic model is that of the {\em
Kalman filter}. This algorithm assumes measurements are a combination of
a true state  and a measurement noise. Each component has its particular
error structure, expressed by a mean and covariance matrix.</p>

<p>For each new time step, the model predicts a new state, the observations
are compared to that new state, and the model errors are used to adjust
(improve) the model before predicting the next step.</p>

<p>Kalman filters are used a lot to optimize deterministic models, and come
nowadays in many flavours, e.g. depending on whether the model is linear
or not, and whether it is used forward in time, or in real-time.</p>

<p><em>Particle filters</em> do this in a stochastic setting.</p>

<h3>Simplified difference equation-type models</h3>

<p>Often, the differential equations are simplified very crudely to the
state where only mass is preserved, but the solution no longer
approximates the true differential equation. Think of simple bucket-type
models in hydrology, where water bodies are buckets and soils are like sponges:
a soil grid cell drains always with an exponential decrease; a soil and
water body grid cells drain <em>instantly</em> when their maximum capacity
is exceeded, with the amount it is exceeded.</p>

<p>Despite the simplifications, these models can be more useful than
attempts to solve the full differential equation, because their data
demand can be more realistically met.</p>

<h3>This is not a plea against the use of any model</h3>

<p>On the contrary, elemenents from physics (such as preservation of energy
and mass) are better than anything else. It is rather a warning, that
putting them blindly before anything else is dangerous.</p>

<p>In any case one should acknowledge the limited availability of data
available for calibration, and the limitations of our ability to
truthfully represent real-world systems for the world around us.</p>

<p>The risk of inapt use (<em>misuse</em>) is not larger for deterministic models
than for stochastic models. But we do tend to rely on them in more
risky situations (scenario&#39;s, future).</p>
