## Random variables

$$
\newcommand{\E}{{\rm E}}       % E expectation operator
\newcommand{\Var}{{\rm Var}}   % Var variance operator
\newcommand{\Cov}{{\rm Cov}}   % Cov covariance operator
\newcommand{\Cor}{{\rm Corr}}
$$


Random variables (RVs) are numeric variables whose outcomes are subject
to chance.

The cumulative distribution of probability $F_x(\cdot)$ over outcomes $z$ 
over all possible values of the RV $Z$ is the probability distribution function:

$$P(Z \le z) = F_Z(z) = \int_{-\infty}^z f_Z(u)du$$
where $f_Z(\cdot)$ is the probability *density* function of $Z$. The
sum of all probability is 1.


## Random variables 

Random variables have an expectation (mean): $E(Z) =
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} u f_Z(u) du$ and a variance: $\Var(Z) =
E[(Z-E(Z))^2]$. 

Try to think of $E(Z)$ as $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} z_i$, with $i \rightarrow \infty$.

Two random variables $X$ and $Y$ have covariance defined as
$\Cov(X,Y) = E[(X-E(X))(Y-E(Y))]$


## Correlation and covariance

Correlation is scaled covariance, scaled by the variances. For two
variables $X$ and $Y$, it is
$$\Cor(X,Y) = \frac{\Cov(X,Y)}{\sqrt{\Var(X)\Var(Y)}}$$

It is quite easy to show that $|\Cov(X,Y)| \le \sqrt{\Var(X)\Var(Y)}$, so correlation
ranges from -1 to 1.  For this, note that $\Cov(X,X)=\Var(X)$.
and $\Cov(X,-X)=-\Var(X)$.

It is perhaps easier to think of covariance as unscaled correlation.

Note: _A large covariance does not imply a strong correlation_


## Expectation, variance, covariance, correlation



Random variable: $Z$ follows a probability distribution, specified by
a density function
$f(z)= \Pr(Z=z)$ or a distribution function $F(z)=\Pr(Z \le z)$

Expectation: $\E(Z) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(s)ds$ -- center of mass, mean.

Variance: $\Var(Z)=\E(Z-\E(Z))^2$ -- mean squared distance from mean;
measure of spread; square root: standard deviation of $Z$.

Covariance: $\Cov(X,Y)=\E((X-\E(X))(Y-\E(Y)))$ -- mean product;
can be negative; $\Cov(X,X)=\Var(X)$.

 Correlation: $r_{XY}=\frac{\Cov(X,Y)}{\sqrt{\Var(X)\Var(Y)}}$ -- normalized
$[-1,1]$ covariance. -1 or +1: perfect correlation.

## What is spatial correlation?

Waldo Tobler's first law in geography:

_"Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more
related than distant things."_ [Tobler, 1970, p.236]*


* *But how then is "being related" expressed?*

the Detroit region". Economic Geography, 46(2): 234-240.


## What is spatial correlation?

Spatial correlation can be explored in different ways. 

One way is to take up an idea from time series: look at lagged correlations, and the $h$-scatterplot.

What is it? Plots of (or correlation between) $Z(s)$ and $Z(s+h)$, where
$s+h$ is $s$, shifted by $h$ (time distance, spatial distance).


## What is spatial correlation? - $h$-scatterplots

```{r,warning=F,echo=FALSE}
library(gstat)
library(sf)
data(meuse, package = "sp")
meuse.sf = st_as_sf(meuse, coords = c("x", "y"))
hscat(log(zinc) ~ 1, meuse.sf, c(0, 30, 80, 100, 200, 300, 500, 1000))
```


## What is spatial correlation? - covariance against distance 

Another way to explore spatial correlation is to plot covariances of values at point pairs against the distance between these points.

```{r,warning=F,echo=F}
x = variogram(log(zinc) ~ 1, meuse.sf, covariogram=TRUE, cloud = T)
plot(x$dist,x$gamma,xlab="distance",ylab="covariance")

```


## What is spatial correlation? - covariance against distance 

* Group into distance classes and look at means

```{r,warning=F,echo=F}
x = variogram(log(zinc) ~ 1, meuse.sf, covariogram=TRUE, cloud = T)
plot(x$dist,x$gamma,xlab="distance",ylab="covariance")
abline(v=seq(from= 100, to=1600, by=100))
```


## What is spatial correlation? - Empirical covariogram


```{r,warning=F,echo=F}
x.vgm = variogram(log(zinc) ~ 1, meuse.sf, covariogram=TRUE)
plot(x.vgm)
```

## What is spatial correlation? - Theroretical covariogram

* Fit a line to the covariogram

```{r,warning=F,echo=F}
x = variogram(log(zinc) ~ 1, meuse.sf, covariogram=TRUE)
x.mod = vgm(-0.52,"Pen",900,0.45)
plot(x,x.mod)
```

## From covariance to semivariance 

In geostatistics the spatial correlation is modelled by the semivariogram instead of a covariogram or correlogram. The term _variogram_ is used synonymously with semivariogram. The (semi) _variogram_ plots semivariance as a function of distance.


From covariance to semivariance


Covariance: $\Cov(Z(s),Z(s+h)) = C(h) = \E[(Z(s)-m)(Z(s+h)-m)]$

Semivariance: $\gamma(h) = \frac{1}{2} \E[(Z(s)-Z(s+h))^2]$

$$\E[(Z(s)-Z(s+h))^2] = \E[(Z(s))^2 + (Z(s+h))^2 -2Z(s)Z(s+h)]$$

Assume $m=0$:

$$\E[(Z(s)-Z(s+h))^2] = \E[(Z(s))^2] + \E[(Z(s+h))^2] - 2\E[Z(s)Z(s+h)] \\ = 2\Var(Z(s)) - 2\Cov(Z(s),Z(s+h)) = 2C(0)-2C(h)$$

$\gamma(h) = C(0)-C(h)$

$\gamma(h)$ is the _semivariogram_ of $Z(s)$.




## The _Variogram_


* the central tool to geostatistics
* like a mean squares (variance) in analysis of variance, like
a $t$ to a $t$-test
* measures spatial correlation
* subject to debate: it involves _modelling_
* synonymous to _semivariogram_, but
* semivariance is _not_ synonymous to variance


## Variogram: how to compute


average squared differences: 
$$\hat{\gamma}(\tilde{h})=\frac{1}{2N_h}\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}(Z(s_i)-Z(s_i+h))^2 \ \ 
h \in \tilde{h}$$

* divide by $2N_h$:
 * if finite, $\gamma(\infty)=\sigma^2$
 * _semi_ variance
* if data are not gridded, group $N_h$ pairs $s_i,s_i+h$ for which
$h \in \tilde{h}$, $\tilde{h}=[h_1,h_2]$
* choose about 10-25 distance intervals $\tilde{h}$, from length
0 to about on third of the area size
* ''plot'' $\tilde{h}$ at the average value of all $h \in \tilde{h}$


## Plotting semivariance against distance


```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
x = variogram(log(zinc) ~ 1, meuse.sf, covariogram=F, cloud = T)
plot(x$dist,x$gamma,xlab="distance",ylab="semivariance")
```


## Plotting semivariance against distance

* Group into distance classes and look at means

```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
x = variogram(log(zinc) ~ 1, meuse.sf, covariogram=F, cloud = T)
plot(x$dist,x$gamma,xlab="distance",ylab="semivariance")
abline(v=seq(from= 100, to=1600, by=100))
```

## The empirical variogram


```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
x.vgm=variogram(log(zinc) ~ 1, meuse.sf, cloud = F)
plot(x.vgm)
```


## The theoretical variogram

* Fit a line to the empirical variogram

```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
x.mod= fit.variogram(x.vgm,vgm(0.6, "Sph", 1000, 0.05))
plot(x.vgm,x.mod)
```


## Variogram: terminology


![](./data/Variogram_example.png)



## Models for variograms

```{r,warning=F,echo=F}
show.vgms()
```


## Why prefer the variogram over the covariogram?

Covariance: $\Cov(Z(s),Z(s+h)) = C(h) = \E[(Z(s)-m)(Z(s+h)-m)]$

Semivariance:  
$\gamma(h) = \frac{1}{2} \E[(Z(s)-Z(s+h))^2]$

$\gamma(h)=C(0)-C(h)$

* tradition
* $C(h)$ needs (an estimate of) $m$, $\gamma(h)$ does not
* $C(0)$ may not exist ($\infty$!), when $\gamma(h)$ does
(e.g., Brownian motion)

## Anisotropy

Some processes are directionally dependent (anisotropic), i.e. _do not_ have identical properties in all directions. When investigating such phenomena the semivariance _does not_ only depend on the distance between two points but also on the direction of the distance vector.

* example: global annual mean temperature.



## Isotropic (left) vs anisotropic (right) process

## Check for Isotropy/Anisotropy

* group values not only regarding distance but also direction of the distance vector
* investigate the resulting variograms

```{r, warning=F,eval=F,echo=T}
plot(variogram(log(zinc)~1, meuse.sf, alpha=c(0,45,90,135)))
```


## Check for Isotropy/Anisotropy

```{r, warning=F,eval=T,echo=F}
plot(variogram(log(zinc)~1, meuse.sf, alpha=c(0,45,90,135)))
```

## Intrinsic Stationarity


In order to be able to estimate spatial correlation from observational data, we need to assume _intrinsic stationarity_.This assumes the underlying process to be a random function composed of a mean and residual 

$Z(s) = m + e(s)$

with a constant mean

$E(Z(s)) = m$

and a variogram defined as

$\gamma(h)= \frac{1}{2}E(Z(s)-Z(s+h))^2$

This imlplies that the variance of $Z$ is constant, and the spatial correlation of $Z$ does not depend on location $(s)$, but only on separation distance $(h)$.
